Well, I tried to follow the specification given by the assignment. How precisely I was able to implement the specification is up to the grader.

I think the button presses are a bit unreliable. I tried interrupt implementation for button handling but it didn’t improve things. I don’t know if it’s the result of not debouncing the buttons.

If you press the left button (randomize) enough times you will get into the game mode. In the game you have to catch the “bomb” falling down with the platform at the bottom. Move the platform left or right with left and right buttons. Catch the bomb 10 times to ge back into assignment mode. This game would benefit from a little sound, but I couldn’t figure out how to get the speaker going.
